# Print Settings  
See original page [here](https://orbiterprojects.com/ender-3-v2/) (Under "Design Parts & Print Settings").
- Use either PETG or ABS(preferred) to print these parts.
- Choose a `hotend base` depending on the hotend you wish to use (the stock hotend is MK8).
- An infill setting of 75% is recommended for the `hotend base` and 20% for all other parts.
- A Layer height of 0.2/0.25 is recommend for the `hotend base` and 0.1/0.15 for all other parts.
- `CR touch holder` and `wire cover` have built in supports that need to be broken off after printing.
